# Python Project Management

## Essential Practices and Concepts
- Virtual Environments: Isolating project dependencies is crucial to avoid conflicts between projects. Tools like uv, Rye, and PDM automate the creation and management of these environments.
- Dependency Management: Modern tools use lock files (often generated from pyproject.toml) to ensure reproducible environments across different machines.
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Tools like PyCharm or VS Code provide robust support for these management tools, offering features like smart code completion, debugging, and environment integration.
- Build Automation: Tools such as PyBuilder can automate software build tasks, testing, and deployment.
